Shopify Automation
Welcome to the Shopify Automation repository! This project provides tools, scripts, and frameworks to automate tasks or test functionalities for Shopify, enabling efficient workflows and ensuring the reliability of Shopify applications.

Overview
This repository demonstrates how to automate Shopify operations or test Shopify stores using frameworks like Selenium, Cucumber, or REST APIs. It simplifies repetitive tasks, reduces manual effort, and ensures consistent results in Shopify environments.

Features
Automated Testing: Perform end-to-end tests for Shopify applications.
API Automation: Interact with Shopify APIs for streamlined workflows.
Scalable Framework: Modular structure for adding new test cases or automation tasks.
Integration: Support for integrating with CI/CD pipelines for continuous testing.

Prerequisites
Ensure the following tools are installed on your system:
Java 8 or higher
Maven or Gradle
Selenium WebDriver (if applicable)
IDE like IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse
Access to a Shopify store and API credentials (if using Shopify APIs)
Setup and Installation
Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/shruthi72/ShopifyAutomation.git  
cd ShopifyAutomation  
Install dependencies:

mvn clean install  
Configure your environment:
If using Shopify APIs, set your API credentials in a configuration file or as environment variables.
Update any test-specific settings in the src/test/resources/config directory.
Usage
Running Automation
Add your test scenarios in the features folder if using Cucumber.
Implement step definitions or automation scripts in the src/test/java directory.

Run the automation scripts using Maven:
mvn test  
Example
Gherkin Feature File (product.feature)
gherkin

Feature: Product Management  
  Scenario: Add a new product to Shopify  
    Given I have valid Shopify API credentials  
    When I create a new product with valid details  
    Then the product should be listed in my Shopify store  
Step Definition (ProductSteps.java)
java
@Given("^I have valid Shopify API credentials$")  
public void setupCredentials() {  
    // Code to set up Shopify API credentials  
}  

@When("^I create a new product with valid details$")  
public void createProduct() {  
    // Code to create a product using Shopify API  
}  

@Then("^the product should be listed in my Shopify store$")  
public void verifyProductInStore() {  
    // Code to verify product presence in the Shopify store  
}
